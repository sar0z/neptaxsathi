## 🌟 Key Features

- **Bilingual Support**: Full English and Nepali language support with seamless switching. All UI elements, labels, and user-facing text are translated.
- **Devanagari Numerals**: When Nepali language is selected, all numerical displays (calculations, percentages, currency values, slab amounts) automatically render in Devanagari numerals (०-९).
- **Dynamic Currency**: Currency symbol adapts based on language — ⨀ for English and रु for Nepali.
- **Noto Sans Devanagari Font**: Automatically applies the Noto Sans Devanagari font to text inputs when Nepali language is selected for proper rendering.
- **Language Selector**: Beautiful circular flag icon dropdown with SVG flags for USA and Nepal for easy language switching.
- **Side-by-Side Comparison**: Instantly see your total income, deductions, taxable income, progressive tax slab breakdown, total yearly/monthly tax, and net income (cash in hand) for both tax regimes in a single view.
- **SSF (Social Security Fund) Toggle**: Applies the waiver/reduction of the first 1% social security tax slab (reducing it to 0%) for SSF contributors.
- **Deduction Cap Enforcement**: Automatically enforces standard Nepalese tax deduction limits:
  - **SSF**: Up to ₨ 5,00,000
  - **Provident Fund (PF) & Citizen Investment Trust (CIT)**: Up to ₨ 3,00,000 (combined)
  - **Life Insurance Premium**: Up to ₨ 40,000
  - **Donations**: Support for donations and other deductions.
- **Marital Status Adjustment**: Choose between **Individual** and **Couple** status. The application automatically updates the respective progressive slab thresholds.
- **Adaptive Layout**: Features a rich two-column dashboard on desktop screen sizes and a smooth, swipeable tabbed navigation system for mobile viewports.
- **Privacy-First**: No data is stored, transmitted, or sent to any server. All calculations run entirely client-side in the user's browser.
- **Analytic Tracking**: Integrated with Umami Analytics to track generic user interaction events (tab switches, calculate button clicks) without compromising user privacy.
